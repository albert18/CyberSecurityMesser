************************************************ Cryptographic Attacks
*You've encrypt data and sent it to another person

*The bad guy doesn't have the combination the(Key)

*Finding ways to undo security

---KPA(Known plaintext attack)
*Attack has the encrypted data and some of the plaintext
*WW2 Enigma cipher

--Password file
*hash

--Rainbow tables
*An optimized, prebuilt set of hashes
    -Doesn't need to contain every hash
    -The calculation have already been done
*Remarkable speed increase
    -Especially with longer password lengths

*Need different tables for different hashing methods
    -Windows is a different than MySql

*Rainbow table wont' work with salted hashes
    -Additional random value added to the original hash

--Dictionary Attack
*People use common words as passwords
*If you're using brute force, you should start with the easy ones
*Many common wordlists available on the net
*This will catch the low hanging fruit

--Brute force
*The password is the Key
    -Secret phrase
    -Stored hash

*Brute force attack 
    -Keep trying to login process
    -very slow
    -Most accounts will lockout

*Brute force the hash - online
    -Obtain the list of users and hashes
    -Calculate a password hash, compare it to a stored hash
    -large computional resource requirement

*Birthday Attack
    -Hash collision
    -Attack will generate multiple version of plaintext to match the hashes

*Collision
    *Hash digest are supposed to be unique
        -Different inout data should never create the same hash

    *MD5 hash
        -Message Difest Algorithm 5
        -First published in april 19982
        -Collision identified in 1996
    
    * December 2008:Researchers created CA certificate that appeared legitimate when MD5 is checked.
        -Built others certificates that appeared to be legit and issued by RapidSSL


*Downgrade Attack

*Weak Implementation
    -Weak encryption
    -802.11 WEP
    -DES - Date Encryption Standard
        -Relatively small 56-bit key
        -Modern systems can brute force this pretty quickly

*Replay Attack
 *Some Cryptographic Algorithms
