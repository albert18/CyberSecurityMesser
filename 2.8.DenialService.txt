------------------------------- Denial of Service
*Force service to fail

*Take advantage of a design failure of vulnerability

*Cause a system to be unavailable

*Create a smokescreen for some other exploit

*Doesnt have to be complicated

-------------------------------- A "Friedly" DOS
*Unintentional DoSing

*Network DoSing

*Bandwidth DOS

*Water line Breaks

-------------------------------- Distributed Denial of Service (DDos)
*Launch an army of computers to bring down a service.
-User all the Bandwidth or resources - traffic spike

*This is why the bad guys have botnets
-Thousands or million of computer at your command
-At its peak, Zeus botnet infected over 3.6 million PCS
-Coordinated Attack

*Asymmetric Threat
-The attacker may have fewer resources than the victim

---------------------------------DDos Amplication
*Turn your small attack into a big attack
-often reflected off another device or service

*An increasingly common DDos technique
-Turn internet services againts the victim

*Uses protocols with little authentication or checks
-NTP, DNS, ICMP
-A common example of protocol abuse
