-------------------------------- A "Friedly" DOS
*Unintentional DoSing

*Network DoSing

*Bandwidth DOS

*Water line Breaks

-------------------------------- Distributed Denial of Service (DDos)
*Launch an army of computers to bring down a service.
-User all the Bandwidth or resources - traffic spike

*This is why the bad guys have botnets
