******************************* Vulnerability Types


**********Race Condition
-A Programming conundrum
-Two bank account with $100
-You need to do a proper validation

********** End-of-life vulnerabilities
-End of life 
    - Vendor support, no security patches
    - You need to upgrade to maintain security

********** Embedded system vulnerabilities
-No direct access to the operating system
-These devices are usually connected to the internet
-Old, outdated operating system software.

********** Lack of Vendor support
-Security requires diligence
-Vendors are the only who can fix their products

********** Improper input handling
-Many application accept user input
-All input should be considered malicious
-Allowing invalid input - sql injection, buffer overflow, denial of service

********** Improper error handling
-Errors happen
-Messages should be just informational enough

********** Misconfiguration/weak configuration

********** Default configuration

********** Untrained Users

********** Improperly configured accounts

********** Vulnerable business processes

********** Weak cipher suites
-The suite
    -Encryption protocol(AES,3DES, etc)
    -Length on the Encryption key (40 bits, 128 bits, 256 bits, etc)
    -Hash used to integrity check (SHA, MD5, etc.)

-Some cipher suites are easier to break than others
    -Stay updated with the latest best practices

-TLS is one the most common issues

-Weak of null encryption

********** Memory/buffer vulnerabilities
-Memory leak
-Integer overflow

********** Memory/buffer vulnerabilities
-Buffer overflow
-NULL pointer deference
-DLL Injection

********** Sytem sprawl/undocumented assets

********** Architecture/design weaknesses
-Examine every part of the network

********** New threats/zero day

********** Improper certificate and key management
