Diversity vs Redundancy


***********Diversity - Bring different control into play



*********** Single computer - protect from malware - INSTALL MALWARE OR Network based Intrusion detection OR Malware access control list


Vendor Diversity



***********A self-directed combination of administrative, physical, and technical controls is an example of: DEFENSE IN DEPTH
A self-directed security plan that includes administrative, physical, and technical controls is referred to 
as defense in depth. Vendor diversity, IT governance, and AAA are all forms of controls used in a 
defense in depth plan, but by themselves donâ€™t represent the defense in depth concept. Any of the controls 
should be used in a good security plan.
