*********Cryptography - is the science/Study - taking data and making it hide in someway and bringing the data back

*********Obfuscation - is to take something to make sense and to hide so it does not make sense to the outside. -LESS VISIBLE/CONFUSION

*********Encryption and De-encryption

*********Ceaser Cipher -

Substitution

ROT2
ROT3

We Attack at Dawn

Cryptanalysis - 

Vigeneri Cipher - give 

1. Algorithm
2. Key for encryption

FACE - 

-Need Algorithm that work with binary data
-Each character takes 8 binary digit

Exclusic OR


***********Data at rest - something stored on the media, storage media

***********Data in transit - moving thru internet to be encrypted

***********data in process - big data process, sitting in RAM, CPU - Where are we going to encrypting and decrypting the data
