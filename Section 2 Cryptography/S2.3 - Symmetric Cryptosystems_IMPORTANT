Symmetric Cryptosystem 

Symemntric Key Algorithm - use same key with Encrypting and De-Crypting

Block Encryption  
**************Data Encryption Standart(DES) - Block Cipher, 64 bits, Initial Permutation, Key size 56 bits, 16 rounds.

Initial Permutation

Subkey - 48 bits

Feistel Function

Short Key - 56 bits is actual short

*********Blowfish - 64-bit Block Size, 16 rounds, 32-448 bits

*********Triple DES - Block Cipher, 64 bits block size, 16 rounds 168 bit


Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) - it is essence, powerful Symmetric
-- Block Cipher, 128-bit Block Size, Key Size: 128, 192, or 256-bits, Rounds 10,12 or 14


Streaming Cipher - A stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (keystream). 
In a stream cipher, each plaintext digit is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the keystream, to give a digit of the

RC4 - streaming of Encryption(Streaming Cipher, 1 bit at a time, 1 round, Key Size: 40-2048 Bits)


QUICK REVIEW

Triple DES (3DES) is the DES key size tripled

AES is a U.S. government encryption standard supported by the NIST
