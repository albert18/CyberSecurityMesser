Electronic Code Book - we do not use with Symmetric(IMPORTANT NO BODY USE ECB ANYMORE)
    - Block modes will always output the same result with the same input.


Note: 
ECB leaves a pattern in the ciphertext. Each encryption block is identical when generated from an identical plaintext.
 All the other methods will create a different output from an identical input source due to incremental count or the
  addition of a nonce number.




Block Mode - encrypt and helps encrypt the next one.(use an initilization vector, which ensures the output block is uniquely different)
    - Cipher Block Chaining(CBC) - 
    - Cipher Feedback(CFB) -
    - Output Feedback(OFB) - 
    - Counter(CTR) -
