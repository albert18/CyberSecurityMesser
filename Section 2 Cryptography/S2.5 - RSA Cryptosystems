 Public keys are paired with a private key (ie Key Pair)
 When using RSA Asymmetric Cryptosystems
 
 ECC can create a smaller key than RSA provides the same security with increased performance





NOTE:RSA is an asymmetric encryption, meaning it encrypts with a different key than it decrypts.
 Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt. Diffie-Hellman is an algorithm, not an encryption type.
  Block mode describes how data is encrypted.








Asymmetric Encryption - Key pair(Public Key, Private key)

RSA - Asymmetric algorithm 

(ECC) Elliptic Curve Cryptography - It can provides us a small key, same robust Asymmetric Encryption
