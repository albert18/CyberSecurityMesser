1. Continuous Access Monitoring - Track log on/Log out, track file

2. Shared Accounts = It is bad thing(Not a good thing)

3. Multiple-Accounts = It just need to happen(You could different username/passwords, use different group)

Big Issue - use least priviledge.

Log Everything



4. Default/Generic Accounts - Always use dedicated account server
