AAA - Authentication, Authorization and Accounting

(Radius)Remote Authencation Dial-In User Service - 
    Radius Server - 
    Radius Client - Gateway that separate that we want to authenticate
    Radius Supplicant - 

 Radius is used in wireless Authencation.(More use in network access,  has 4 port(1812, 1813, 1645, 1646)).

 (TACACS+) Terminal Access Controller Access, Control System Plus - 
    Uses TCP port 49, 
    decouple the Authorization from the Authentication.


BOTH Radius & TACACS - do auditing for log files(Keep Track)


NOTE:
The system trying to authenticate is correct. The system that checks the authentication is the RADIUS server. The system that acts as the gateway is the RADIUS client, and the last has nothing to do with RADIUS set-up or functionality.
