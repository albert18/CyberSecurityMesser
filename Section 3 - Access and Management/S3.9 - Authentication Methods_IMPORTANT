Password Authentication Protocol(PAP) - oldest authentication is Security+
   -Not we don't use it anymore
   -Send it information in Clear(hahahaha)


Challenge-Hangshake Authentication Protocol(CHAP) - First authentication to use in PC World(uses a hash valu to authenticate) 


NT LAN Manager - More use in advance Windows - has Challenge Message


Kerberos -
   Key Distribution Center(KDC) -

Ticket Granting Ticket(TGT) - 

Session Key - 




Security Assertion Markup Language(SAML) - used for web application




*****Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP) - not authentication, but mostly structured language allows to query and update what needs to do. (USE TCP/UDP 389 ) 


NOTE:
Key distribution center is correct. PAP and CHAP are both authentication methods, and a gateway is the system that routes traffic from inside to outside a network.
