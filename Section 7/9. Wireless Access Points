Wireless Access Point - 

Think Client - Stand Alone Access Point

Thin Client - has to be handle in controller base

DBI = Signal Strength(Think of like a boost)

-----Antenna Types-----
Omni direction - Look like a basketball, all direction 
Dipole - Antennas
Directional - a long beam
Parabolic - long distance

Patch - 

Band Selection
    -It has 2 802.11
        2.4 ghz - you have specific channel, 
        5 ghz -  

NOTE: The 2.4 GHz band provides coverage at a longer range but transmits data at slower speeds. The 5 GHz band provides less coverage but transmits data 
at faster speeds. ... However, higher frequencies allow data to be transmitted faster than lower frequencies, so the 5 GHz band allows you to upload and 
download files faster.

Quick Review
    - Wireless access points can be a thich client or a thin client

    - Thin client are confgured through a controller and make it easier to configure multiple units

    - Omni, dipole, directional and patch are all antenna types, each type has a specific signal pattern.
