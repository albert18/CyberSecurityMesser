    RBAC - Rule-based access control - complex mathematics to create sets of object
    ABAC - Attribute Base access control - Tags 

    **
    Role-based access control (RBAC) is a modification of DAC that provides a set of organizational roles that users may be assigned in order to gain access rights. 
    The system is non-discretionary since the individual users cannot modify the ACL of a resource. Users gain their access rights implicitly based on the groups to which
    they are assigned as members.

Transference (or sharing) means assigning risk to a third party (such as an insurance company or a contract with a supplier that defines liabilities). 
Avoidance means that the company stops doing the activity that is risk-bearing. Risk mitigation is the overall process of reducing exposure to or the effects of risk factors, such as by patching a vulnerable system. 
Acceptance means that no countermeasures are put in place either because the level of risk does not justify the cost or because there will be an unavoidable delay before the countermeasures are deployed.

    Vulnerability Scanning - a technique that identifies threats on the network without exploiting them
    Network Sniffing - The process of finding and investigating other computers on the network by analyzing the network traffic or capturing the packets(It called packet sniffer or packet sniffer)

    Password Analysis - A tool used to test strength of your password to ensure your password policies are being followed
        -Password Cracker
        -Password Guessing
        -Brute force Attack
        -Cryptanalysis Attack

NOTE****
Nmap sends specially crafted packets to the target host(s) and then analyzes the responses to determine the open ports and services running on those hosts. 
In addition, nmap can determine the versions of the applications being used on those ports and services. Nmap is a command-line tool for use on Linux, Windows,
 and macOS systems.


A brute-force attack when an attacker uses a set of predefined values to attack a target and analyze the response until he succeeds.
Success depends on the set of predefined values. If it is larger, then it will take more time, but there is a better probability of success. 
In a traditional brute-force attack, the passcode or password is incrementally increased by one letter/number each time until the right passcode/password is found.

SIEM

SOAR - Security Orchestration Automation n and Response - a class of security tools taht facilitates incident response threat hunting, and security Configuration
        by orchestrating automated runbooks and delivering data enrichment

        SOAR is primarily used for incident response
        

****
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is commonly used to gather information from routers, switches, and other network devices. 
It provides information about a device's status, including CPU and memory utilization, as well as many other useful details about the device. 
NetFlow provides information about network traffic. A management information base (MIB) is a database used for managing the entities in a communication network. 
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a communication protocol for electronic mail transmission.

A security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is used to facilitate incident response, threat hunting, 
and security configuration by orchestrating automated runbooks and delivering data enrichment. A SOAR may be implemented as a standalone technology or 
integrated within a SIEM as a next-gen SIEM. A SOAR can scan the organization's store of security and threat intelligence, 
analyze it using machine/deep learning techniques, and then use that data to automate and provide data enrichment for the workflows that drive 
incident response and threat hunting.

The syslog server is a centralized log management solution. By looking through the logs on the syslog server, the technician could determine which 
service failed on which server, since all the logs are retained on the syslog server from all of the network devices and servers.

Cryptography - practice and study of writing and solving codes on order to hide the true meaning of information.

        Encryption - process of converting ordinary(plaintext) into an unintelligible form (ciphertext).

        Data at Rest - inactive data that is archived such as data resident on a hard drive.

        Data in Use - data that in undergoing constant change

        Cipher is an algorithm which performs the encryption or decryption


Symmetric and Asymmetric
    Symmetric(Private Key) - Encryption algorithm in which both sender and the receiver must know the same secret using privately held key.
    Asymmetric - (Public Key) - Encryption algorithm where different keys are used to Encrypt and decrypt the data.

    Stream cipher - utilize a keystream generator to Encrypt data bit using a mathematical XOR function

    Block Cipher - Breaks the input into fixed-length blocks of data and performs the encryption on each block.


Symmetric algorithm
    DES - Encryption algorithm which breaks the input into 64 bit, create ciphertext using key strength of 56 bits(Not secure, was use back in 70's)
    3DES - 3x56 bits that was use
    IDEA(International data encryption algorithm) - Symmetric block cipher which use 64 bit to Encrypt plaintext into cipher (128 bits)
    AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) - Symmetric block cipher that uses 128 bit, 192 bit or 256 bit and matching encryption key in to Encrypt into ciphertext. (Widely use)
    Blowfish - Symmetric block cipher that uses 64 bit blocks and  a variable length encryption key to Encrypt plaintext into ciphertext.
    Two Fish - 128 bit block, 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit
    RC4(Rivest Cipher) -  cipher using variable key size from 40-bits to 2048-bits that is used in SSL and WEP-- ONLY STREAM CIPHER THE REST IS BLOCK CIPHER
    RC5 - 2048-bit replace DES and AES
    RC6 - 



Public Key Cryptography
    Use Key Pair(Private key and Public Key)
    Digital Signature -

    TIPS - Asymmetric encryption is also know as public key Cryptography.
            Two key are used, Encrypt it and decrypt

Asymmetric algorithm
    Diffie-Hellman - used to conduct key exchanges and secure key(Widely setting VPN or Encrypting tunnel)
    RSA(Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) - Asymmetric algorithm that relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoing large primer numbers. (1024-bits to 4096-bits)
    ECC(Elliptic Curve Cryptography) - algorithm that is based upon the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields to define the keys(Heavely use in MOBILE DEVICES)

    ECDH
    ECDHE
    ECDSA


Pretty Good Privacy(PGP) - encryption program used for signing, encryption and decrypting emails(Symmetric functions use 128-bit or higher and Asymmetric function use 512 to 2048 bit)
    (GNU)Privacy Guard - 


Key Management - Refers how to generate, exchange, store


One-Time PAD - stream cipher that Encrypt plaintext information with a secret random key that in the same length as the plaintext input.

Cryptography Considerations
    Blockchain - shared immutable ledger for recording transactions tracking assets and building trust.
    Public ledger - keeping record system that Maintain participants identities
    Quantum Computing - a computer that uses quantum mechanics to generate and manipulate quantum bits(qubits) in order to access enormous processing powers.
    Quantum communication - communication network that relies on qubits made of protons(light) to send multiple combinations of 1s
    Ephemeral - short lived used in the key exchange for WPA3


**
Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. As a public-key cryptosystem, 
it relies on an asymmetric algorithm. Twofish, RC4, and DES are all symmetric algorithms.


The only truly unbreakable encryption is one that uses a one-time use pad. This ensures that every message is encrypted with a different shared key that only the two owners of the one-time use pad would know.
 This technique ensures that there is no pattern in the key for an attacker to guess or find. Even if one of the messages could be broken, all of the other messages would remain secure since they use different 
 keys to encrypt them. Unfortunately, one-time use pads require that two identical copies of the pad are produced and distributed securely before they can be used.

The most likely explanation is that the user utilized steganography to hide the leaked data inside the photos from their trip. Steganography is the process of hiding one message inside another. 
By hiding the customer’s information within the digital photos, the incident response team would not be able to see the data being hidden without knowing to look for it inside the seemingly
 benign pictures from the trip.
