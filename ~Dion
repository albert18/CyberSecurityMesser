Virtualization
    VM
        System Virtual Machine
        Processor Virtual Machine

Hypervisor(Manages the distribution of the physical resources of a Host
            machine(server) to the virtual machines being run(guests))
    Type 1 - Bare Metal Hypervisor(strip down)
    Type 2 - Virtual box for sample
    Application Containerization - i.e. Docker

Threat Virtual Machine
    Elasticity - scale up, scale down
    Data Remnants - 
    Privilege Elevation -

Virtual machine escape vulnerabilities are the most severe issue that 
may exist in a virtualized environment. 
In this attack, the attacker has access to a single virtual host and 
then leverages that access to intrude on the resources assigned 
to different virtual machines.
